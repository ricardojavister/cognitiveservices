The goal of this project is to illustrate how integrate Angular , .net 7.0 and the cognitive services from Azure.

Application to interpret images using Azure - Computer Vision, .net and angular.

Cognitive Services in Azure is a comprehensive suite of cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) services and APIs that empower developers to integrate AI capabilities into their applications without the need for extensive AI expertise. These services are designed to help you build intelligent applications that can see, hear, speak, understand, and interpret user needs.

With Azure Cognitive Services, you can tap into the power of AI to perform tasks such as natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, and more. These services enable you to enhance user experiences, automate processes, and gain valuable insights from your data.

Key features of Azure Cognitive Services include:

- **Vision**: Services that enable image and video analysis, including facial recognition and object detection.
- **Language**: Services for text and language understanding, translation, and sentiment analysis.
- **Speech**: Services for converting spoken language into written text and vice versa.
- **Decision**: Services that help you make intelligent decisions using AI models and recommendations.

Whether you're building applications for healthcare, e-commerce, customer support, or any other domain, Azure Cognitive Services can be a valuable addition to your toolkit, making it easier to infuse AI capabilities into your solutions.
